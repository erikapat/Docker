Running it in the container ensures that the process is truly repeatable and provides an important quality control check. To make sure we can do this, the one piece we still need is a requirements.txt file (or Pipfile, if you use Pipenv). If you don’t have one (as above), you can run pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
